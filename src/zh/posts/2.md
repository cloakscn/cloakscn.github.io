My seven-year-old grandson sleeps just down the hall from me, and he wakes up a lot of mornings and he says, "You know, this could be the best day ever." And other times, in the middle of the night, he calls out in a tremulous[^tremulous] voice, "Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"

[^tremulous]: adj. 颤抖的

I think this pretty much says it for me and most of the people I konw, that we're a mixed grill of happy anticipation[^anticipation] and dread. So I sat down a few days before my 61st birthday, and I decided to compile[^compile] a list of everything I know for sure. There's so little truth in the popular culture, and it's good to be sure of a few things. For instance, I am no longer 47, although this is the age I feel, and the age I like to think of myself as bing. My friend Paul used to say in his 70s that he felt like a young man with something really wrong with him.

[^compile]: v. 编写
[^anticipation]: n. 期盼；期望

Our true person is outside of time and space, but looking at the paperwork, I can, in fact, see that I was born in 1954. My inside self is outside of time and space. It doesn't have an age.

I'm every age I've ever been, and so are you, although I can't help mentioning as an aside that it might have been helpfull if I hadn't followed the skin care rules of the '60s, which involed getting as much sun as poosible while slathered[^slathere] in baby oil and basking in the glow of a tinfoil reflector shield.

[^slathere]: v. 厚厚涂抹

It was so liberating[^liberating], though, to face the truth that I was no longer in the last throes of middle age, that I decided to write down every single true thing I know. People feel really doomed and overwhelmed these days, and they keep asking me what's true. So I hope that my list of things I'm almost positive about might offer some basic operating instructions to anyone who is feeling really overwhelmed of beleaguered[^beleaguered].

[^liberatng]: adj. 解脱的
[^beleaguered]: adj. 处于困境的
