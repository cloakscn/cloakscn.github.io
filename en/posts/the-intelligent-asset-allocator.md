## Chapter 1: General Introduction

Imagine depositing $5000 each year into your personal pension account, or receiving it directly into your hands. If you put it in the pension account, you need to flip a coin to determine whether you'll have a profit ($30\%$) or a loss ($10\%$). If you take it directly, there will be an annual interest rate of $3\%$. Which option is better?

This is a simple investment plan. You realize that flipping a coin will generate two possible outcomes, each with the same probability:

| Index | Outcome | Total Rate of Return |
| ----- | ------- | --------------------- |
| 1     | Heads   | $30\%$                |
| 2     | Tails   | $-10\%$               |

Since the probabilities are the same, and in a representative two-year practice, each of these two outcomes will occur once, you'll find that your pension will grow as follows:

$$1.3 \times 0.9 = 1.17$$

Every $1 you had two years ago has now become $1.17. With your mathematical prowess, you calculate that the annualized return rate of coin flipping is $8.17\%$, which is significantly higher than the annual $3\%$ return. Of course, you might encounter a series of misfortunes resulting in more tails than heads. However, when you perform some calculations, you'll discover that to get the return of the first choice, you need at least $12$ heads and at most $23$ tails. The probability of such an unfortunate event is extremely low.

**So, we derive the first rule:**

> Choose between "safe" currency market accounts and treasury bonds and the "gambling" ordinary stocks. The second option provides almost certain higher returns but comes at a cost: there is a very small probability of losses, and more importantly, you have to endure the painful coin-tossing process with Uncle Fred every year. But the choice of a $3\%$ bank deposit is the most frighteningâ€”you are destined to spend your old age in poverty.

## Chapter 2: Risk and Return

1. Risk and return are inseparable. Do not expect to have low risk while enjoying high returns, and do not crave safety while despising low returns.
2. The longer the holding period of risky assets, the lower the probability of suffering severe losses.
3. The risk of assets or portfolios can be measured. The simplest method is to calculate the standard deviation of returns over different periods.
4. Those who do not pay attention to investment history will make mistakes repeatedly. People should carefully study historical data on investment returns and risks. Investment data for a sufficiently long duration (usually more than 20 years) is helpful in predicting the future returns and risks of the asset. Additionally, estimating the long-term returns and risks of a portfolio composed of that asset is also achievable.
